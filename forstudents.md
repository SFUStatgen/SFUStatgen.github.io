# Information for Prospective Students

We are based in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at SFU. 
The Group welcomes all students with interests in statistics and/or statistical computing who share a curiousity about genetics and biology. 
Students in the group enroll in the Department's graduate programme.
More information on StatGen and graduate studies in Statistics at SFU is available through the following links.

We have drafted a short summary of <a href="/forstudents/expectations.html">our expectations</a>.<br>
The Department has also prepared a list of <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/content/dam/sfu/stat/documents/Statgen/PrepMaterial.pdf">useful preparatory material for Masters students</a> entering our program; Statistics graduate students should focus on the Stat Theory and Linear Models components of this list.

There are many writing resources available on the web, such as tutorials on <a href="http://www.essaywritinghelp.com/outline.htm">how to write an outline </a> and <a href="https://canvas.sfu.ca/courses/15986">understanding plagiarism</a>. Our group also maintains a page with some local <a href="resources.html">research and programming resources</a> that we use a lot. Finally, the SFU <a href="http://learningcommons.sfu.ca/">Student Learning Commons</a> can provide personalized help with writing, learning, and study strategies.
