# Website for Graham & McNeney Labs


### Welcome!

The group has research interests in Statistical Genetics and Genetic Epidemiology.  We are primarily based in the [Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science](https://www.sfu.ca/stat-actsci.html) at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca), Burnaby and are part of the larger [Statistics in the Life Sciences (SiLS) group](https://wiki.its.sfu.ca/research/sils/index.php/Main_Page).

Please see our [Members](/members.html) page to learn more about who we are and our [Research Projects](/research.html) page for a description of research projects and available software.  The Group welcomes all students with interests in statistics and/or statistical computing who share a curiousity about genetics and biology.  Prospective students may find the webpage [For Students](/forstudents.html) to be helpful. Or, visit any of the links in the navigation area at the top of the page to find out more.
