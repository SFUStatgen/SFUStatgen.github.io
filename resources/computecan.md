# Introduction to Alliance Canada

## Resources for working on Alliance Canada

See
* [Getting started](computecan_gettingstarted.md), for information on registering for an account, learning Unix, and logging in to the system.
* [Running jobs](computecan_runningjobs.md), for information on creating batch scripts and submitting them to the scheduler
* [Working with files and file quotas](computecan_filesquotas.md), for information about the Compute Canada filesystem and quota system.

### Getting help

If the above don't help, consult one of the following resources:
* The [Alliance Canada Documentation wiki](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Technical_documentation) is the authoritative, though somewhat intimidating, source for information about Compute Canada.
* WestGrid (the Western Canada division of Compute Canada) has its own [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/WGSeminarSeries) where they post videos of past seminars/webinars.
* Sharcnet (the Ontario division of Compute Canada) also has a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCRmb5_GMWT2hSlALHlwIMg). Their "new users" webinars look useful.
* Contact [Alliance Canada tech support](https://www.alliancecan.ca/en/contact-us).
