## Resources for working on Compute Canada

We have a few pages to get people started:
* [computecan_gettingstarted.md](Getting started)
* [computecan_runningjobs.md](Running jobs)
* [computecan_filesquotas.md](Working with files and file quotas)

### Getting help

If the above don't help, consult one of the following resources:
* WestGrid (the Western Canada division of Compute Canada) has its own [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/WGSeminarSeries) where they post videos of past seminars/webinars.
* Sharcnet (the Ontario division of Compute Canada) also has a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCRmb5_GMWT2hSlALHlwIMg). Their "new users" webinars look useful.
* Contact [Compute Canada tech support](https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Technical_support).
