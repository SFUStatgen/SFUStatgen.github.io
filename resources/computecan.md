# Getting started with Compute Canada

### Registering for an account

Before you can use the Compute Canada resources you will need to register for an account. Your account will be linked to a "sponsor", 
so before you start the registration, send an email to your supervisor (Jinko or Brad) and ask them for their Compute Canada
user ID (CCRI).

Next, go to the Compute Canada login/registration page at

[https://ccdb.computecanada.ca/security/login](https://ccdb.computecanada.ca/security/login)

and click on "Register" near the bottom right. Fill out the following application pages. When asked about your "Position" say MSc or PhD 
student, as appropriate, under "Sponsored User". After you submit the form, the Compute Canada system should send your supervisor
an email to approve your request. Please let them know when you submit the form so that they can keep an eye out for the approval email.

### Getting to know Unix

The Compute Canada servers run the Unix operating system. If you are unfamiliar with Unix, you can consult an online tutorial, such as [this one](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~ggbaker/reference/unix/).

### Logging in to cedar

The cluster that we use most is called [cedar.computecanada.ca](https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Cedar). You will need to log in 
with an SSH client. See the Compute Canada [documentation on SSH](https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/SSH) for more information.

### Running your jobs

To run a job you must create what's called a "batch script" and submit it to a "scheduler". 

* See the [introduction to schedulers](https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/What_is_a_scheduler%3F) for background
* See the [running jobs](https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Running_jobs) documentation for details.

### Getting help

**Don't be afraid to ask for help!!** Computing on a cluster has a rather steep learning curve. We've all struggled.
Feel free to ask other members (particularly other students) in the group for advice. If none of us can help, contact [Compute Canada tech support](https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Technical_support).

### Running R in batch mode

* See the [Parallel Computing in R with WestGrid](https://www.sfu.ca/content/dam/sfu/stat/documents/Statgen/ParallelComputing_inR_CC.pdf)
 presentation by Bhagya Karunarathna. (Note: WestGrid is the western-Canada division of Compute Canada.)
